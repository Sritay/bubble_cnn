Deep Learning for Bubble Fate Prediction in MDThis project implements a 3D Spatio-Temporal Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the stability fate of nanobubbles from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. It processes raw LAMMPS trajectories, converts atomic coordinates into volumetric density grids, and predicts whether a bubble is Stable, Collapsing, or Coalescing.Key FeaturesEnd-to-End Pipeline: Reads raw LAMMPS dump files using MDAnalysis and outputs classification predictions.3D Voxelization: Converts continuous particle positions into discrete 3D density tensors ($64 \times 64 \times 64$ grid).Spatio-Temporal Learning: Stacks $T=5$ consecutive frames to allow the model to learn from motion and velocity, not just static shape.HPC Ready: Includes Singularity definition files and Slurm scripts for deployment on clusters like ARCHER2.UsagePrerequisitesPython 3.10+PyTorch (CPU or CUDA)MDAnalysis, NumPy, TqdmRunning TrainingConfigure the DUMP_FILES and Y_LABELS_LIST in bubble_fate_predictor.py.Run:python bubble_fate_predictor.py
This will train the model, save the weights to bubble_fate_predictor_model.pth, and output evaluation metrics.Running InferenceTo predict the fate of a new, unlabeled trajectory:Ensure the trained model (.pth) is present.Update NEW_DUMP_FILE in predict_fate.py.Run:python predict_fate.py
Model Limitations & Caveats1. Dataset Size & AccuracyThe current model achieves 100% accuracy on the test set. This is a "Proof of Concept" result derived from a small dataset (~300 windows).Data Leakage: The training and test sets were split randomly from the same continuous trajectories. Due to the sliding window approach ($T=5$), there is significant overlap between frames in the training and test sets, helping the model "memorize" sequences.Generalization: To prove true generalization, the model should be tested on entirely new trajectories that were not seen during training.2. Field of ViewThe voxel grid is fixed to a 160 Å ($16 \text{ nm}$) box width. Bubbles larger than this diameter will be cropped, potentially losing surface information.3. Density-Based VoxelizationThe current voxelizer counts all atoms (liquid and gas) to create a density map. It does not separate them into different channels. The model relies on the density contrast between the gas core and the surrounding liquid to identify shapes.
